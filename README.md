# Tweety is an application made to extract twitter information.

The "w.txt" file must contain a list of words in each line with the topics we want to search about.
In the "k.txt" file we will set our tweeter developer credentials.
The name, tweet, creation date... data will be stored in a google spreadsheet to make it available anywhere, anytime.

The info will also be available in a .csv file.
